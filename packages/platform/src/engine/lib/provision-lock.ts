/**
 * Provisioning lock — serializes server/workspace-scoped provisioning across
 * concurrent deploys so they never race the target's shared state (apt/dpkg,
 * the openresty unit + config, docker networks, the setup-state file).
 *
 * Two layers:
 *   A. An in-process keyed async-mutex (module singleton) — serializes callers
 *      in THIS process by scopeKey, and collapses N same-process waiters into a
 *      single downstream waiter. Correct on its own for single-process deploys.
 *   B. A Postgres session-level advisory lock (via @repo/db) — serializes across
 *      processes/replicas that share the database. On PGlite (single embedded
 *      process) it's a passthrough; layer A already covers that case.
 *
 * Because the advisory lock runs INSIDE the mutex, at most one caller per process
 * ever waits on it — so at most (#replicas) DB connections are ever blocked on a
 * given scope, well under the pool ceiling even under heavy deploy fan-out.
